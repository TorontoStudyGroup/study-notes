# Chapter 2: BACK-OF-THE-ENVELOPE ESTIMATION

:::note
Back-of-the-envelope estimation is a key skill in system design interviews. The focus is on your reasoning and logic, not the exact result.
:::

## Key Takeaways

- **What is Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation?**
  - Quick, rough estimation to evaluate system capacity or performance requirements in the early design stage.
  - The goal is not perfect accuracy, but a clear, logical estimation process, with all assumptions and units written down.

- **Power of Two Basics**
  - Know your data units (Byte, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB) and use powers of two for calculations.
  - 1 Byte = 8 bits, 1 KB = 1024 Bytes, 1 MB = 1024 KB, and so on.

- **Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know**
  - Memory operations are extremely fast, disk and network are much slower.
  - Example: L1 cache = a few ns, Disk seek = ms, Cross-region network = 100+ ms.
  - Always compress data before sending over the network if possible; avoid frequent disk I/O.

- **Availability Numbers (SLA, “Nines”)**
  - High availability is often expressed in “nines” (e.g., 99.9%, 99.99% uptime).
  - More nines = less downtime. For example, 99.9% means about 8.7 hours downtime per year.

- **Example: Twitter QPS and Storage Estimation**
  - **Assumptions:**
    - 300M monthly active users
    - 50% daily active
    - 2 tweets/user/day
    - 10% tweets contain media
    - Store data for 5 years
  - **Estimation:**
    - DAU = 300M × 50% = 150M
    - Tweet QPS = 150M × 2 / 24 / 3600 ≈ 3,500 QPS
    - Peak QPS ≈ 7,000 QPS
    - Media storage per day ≈ 30TB
    - 5-year media storage ≈ 55PB

- **Interview Tips**
  - Focus on process, not the final number.
  - Use round numbers and simple math (e.g., approximate 99987/9.1 as 100,000/10).
  - Clearly state all assumptions.
  - Always write down your units (e.g., 5 MB, 30 TB).
  - Practice estimating QPS, storage, cache, and number of servers.

## Example: Twitter QPS and Storage Estimation

**Assumptions:**
- 300 million monthly active users
- 50% daily active users
- 2 tweets per user per day
- 10% of tweets contain media
- Store data for 5 years

**Estimation:**
- DAU = 300M × 50% = 150M
- Tweet QPS = 150M × 2 / 24 / 3600 ≈ 3,500 QPS
- Peak QPS ≈ 7,000 QPS
- Media storage/day = 150M × 2 × 10% × 1MB = 30TB
- 5-year media storage = 30TB × 365 × 5 = 55PB

## Tips for Effective Estimation

- **Process is more important than the answer.** Show your logical reasoning and structured approach.
- **Approximate when necessary.** Don’t get stuck on complex calculations.
- **Write down all assumptions** so your thinking is transparent.
- **Label every number with units** to avoid confusion.
- **Practice with common topics**: QPS, peak QPS, storage, cache, number of servers, etc.
