# Chapter 1: Scale From Zero to Millions of Users

:::note
Designing a system that can support millions of users is a challenge.
:::

## Single Server

This is the simplest architecture diagram:

![Single Server Architecture](./images/ch1-1.png)

Request process diagram:

- **All components hosted on a same machine**: web server, application server, database, cache, etc.
- **Typical Request Process**:

  1.  DNS resolution to find the server's IP address.
  2.  Browser / APP directly sends HTTP request to the server though the IP address.
  3.  Server processes the request and responds with HTML, JSON, or other data formats. (JSON is commonly used for APIs.)

            ```
            GET /api/v1/users/123 HTTP/1.1
            {
              "id": 123,
              "name": "John Smith",
              "email": "john.smith@example.com",
              "phone": "123-456-7890",
            }
            ```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**:

  - Simple to set up and manage
  - Low cost for small-scale applications
  - Easy to develop and test locally

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited scalability
  - Performance bottlenecks
  - Single point of failure, no redundancy

## Database

![Database Architecture](./images/ch1-3.png)

- Separate web server and database server allows to adjust resources independently.

### Compare Database Types

1. **Relational Database (RDBMS)**:

- Structured data with predefined schema
- Supports SQL queries
- ACID properties for data integrity
- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle

2. **NoSQL Database**:

- Unstructured data
- Flexible schema, can handle large volumes of data
- Low latency for applications
- Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j

:::info
**ACID**

> ACID is the four core properties of database transactions.

- **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction are completed successfully or none at all.
- **Consistency**: The database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other, preventing interference.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, it remains in the database even in the event of a system failure.

## Vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling

|                   | **Vertical Scaling** (Scale-Up)                 | **Horizontal Scaling** (Scale-Out)               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Method**        | Add more CPU/RAM to a single server             | Add more nodes (servers) to the system           |
| **Advantages**    | Simple to implement, no need for data sharding  | No hardware limits, built-in redundancy          |
| **Disadvantages** | Physical limits, single point of failure (SPOF) | More complex deployment, requires load balancing |

## Load Balancer

Single entry point IP that distributes traffic evenly to multiple servers.

![Load Balancer Architecture](./images/ch1-4.png)

- Automatic failover
- Flexible add or remove servers on demand
- Internal servers communicate using private IPs, enhancing security

## Database Replication

- **Master**: Handles all write operations(Insert, Update, Delete), replicates data to slaves
- **Slave**: Read only; typically, there are more slaves than masters

![Database Replication Architecture](./images/ch1-5.png)

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**:
  - Read-write separation improves performance
  - Improved read performance
  - Data redundancy
  - Fault tolerance
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Replication lag
  - Write bottleneck
  - Application complexity
  - Increased cost

## Cache Layer

:::tip
This web server tier checks the cache first before querying the database.
:::

### Common Strategies

- **Cache-Aside(Lazy Loading)**: Application checks cache first, if hit, return data; if miss, query database and update cache.
  - **Pros**: Simple to implement, the cache only stores data that has been used or is frequently accessed.
  - **Cons**: The initial read may have higher latency and could return outdated data.
- **Read-Through**: Cache is updated automatically by cache system when data is read from the database.
  - **Pros**: Logic in application is simplified, cache is always up-to-date.
  - **Cons**: More complex to implement, requires cache system that supports this feature.
- **Refresh-Ahead**: When the cache is accessed, the backend will synchronously update the data to extend the TTL.
  - **Pros**: Avoid cache misses causing delays when TTL expires, ensures popular data is always available.
  - **Cons**: Complex implementation, may lead to unnecessary updates if data is not accessed frequently.

### Strategies Compare

| Strategy Name | Cache Hit Logic                        | Responsible Party               | Latency Risk Points                             | Complexity |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Cache‑Aside   | Application loads data on miss         | Application                     | Consistency of initial reading and updated data | Low        |
| Read‑Through  | Cache layer auto-loads from DB on miss | Cache System                    | Slow on cache miss                              | Medium     |
| Refresh‑Ahead | Background refresh before TTL expiry   | Cache System/Background Process | Waste if prediction is poor                     | High       |

### Recommended Cache Strategies

> Focus on optimizing read performance

- For quickly implement and simple to maintain: **Cache-Aside**
- For automatically handle misses and updates: **Read-Through**
- For low latency and predictable data access patterns: **Refresh-Ahead**
